- Section pages use URLs with `/Document/<id>`.
- The ID in the URL is not predictable.
- The page shows the full hierarchy:
  Title → Division → Chapter → Section.
- Section content includes:
  - Main regulation text
  - Subsections
  - History
  - Authority and reference
- This page represents exactly one CCR section.
